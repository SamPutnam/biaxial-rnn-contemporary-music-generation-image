So, using the [RNN](https://github.com/hexahedria/biaxial-rnn-music-composition), the output file had repeated sections of ~20 notes from these individual midi files in this repo. You can run this, but you only have a small number of midi training files here, so, I'm currently trying WaveNET (https://github.com/ibab/tensorflow-wavenet) to see if it can learn from few observations (official release by DeepMind expected soon @ https://github.com/tensorflow/magenta/tree/master/magenta/models/).

Did use Magenta's basic_rnn the other day: [samputnam.org](http://samputnam.org/deep-learning-zero-to-one-music-generation)
